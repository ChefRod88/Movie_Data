# Movie_Data
This project is a Flask web application that showcases popular movies from 2000 to 2010, utilizing API integration for automation. It pulls movie titles, ratings, and revenues from The Movie Database (TMDB) API and employs OpenAIâ€™s API (ChatGPT) to enable user queries about the movies. The data is stored in an SQLite database and display via HTML.
